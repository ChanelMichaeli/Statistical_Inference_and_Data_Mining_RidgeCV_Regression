# Statistical_Inference_and_Data_Mining_RidgeCV_Regression

The project was done as part of a Kaggel competition described in the following link:

https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview

Our job is to predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, we need to predict the value of
the SalePrice variable. Submissions are evaluated on Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm
of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price. (Taking logs means that errors in predicting
expensive houses and cheap houses will affect the result equally.) For this competition, we will use RidgeCV
Regression to predict the house price.

The python code is in the Mid_term_Project jupyter file. The code is also described in the Mid_term_Project pdf file. 
In addition a MidTerm Project presentation file is attached in a pdf file.
